# Interview Questions for Python Developers

This repository contains questions and answers to help prepare for a Python developer interview. Please don't take the answers as gospel truth, as I am a beginner developer and created this for my own use.

Firstly, prepare for the interview by studying all the relevant topics that I think are relevant in this field. Secondly, implement everything in English and practice it while reviewing the material.

Sources included both Russian and English articles and books, as well as similar repositories found on Github.

I did this because when analyzing similar projects, I noticed that explanations for some questions were incomplete, and I wanted to understand them more deeply.

### However, as I mentioned earlier, I am a beginner and cannot guarantee the absence of errors in the information I provided, so:

- If you are a native English speaker and find that the text is nonsense or there are lexical errors, please submit a pull request.
- If you are familiar with the topic and would like to suggest corrections regarding the questions and answers themselves, please submit a pull request.
